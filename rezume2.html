        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a passionate Web Developer specializing in Java. I have a strong background in building scalable and efficient web applications. My portfolio showcases my ability to manage complex projects and deliver high-quality results.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>I have three higher education degrees, each of which I have work experience in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Law</li>
            <li>Master of Economics (currently working as a Chief Accountant in this field)</li>
            <li>Developer (I have higher education in this specialty as well)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I have extensive life and professional experience using various applications, including web applications, which is undoubtedly very useful when developing application functionality. During my education, I studied Java and Spring in depth, and I also have basic knowledge of C#, Python, JavaScript, and markup languages HTML and CSS. I am currently taking a course on advanced front-end development in JavaScript. In the future, I plan to become a full-stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have knowledge of English at level A1, but I continue to study and plan to obtain an official certificate at level B1 or B2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hobbies: programming and traveling. My husband and I dream of moving to Tenerife, where it is eternal spring, and traveling the world. Family: Husband and two furry children (cats). I was born in Russia, grew up in Lithuania in the city of Å iauliai. I moved and studied in Russia after Lithuania left the USSR. By views, I am more of a pacifist, so I consider any violence of anyone against anyone unacceptable. Although I am not a fanatic. I believe everyone has the right to their own opinion. I love communicating with interesting people with unusual views of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I want from work: I want to work in a team of easy-going, respectful people who set goals and achieve them, but have humor and a kind heart to support each other in moments of burnout. I am self-sufficient, I can work alone when goals and tasks are clearly set (there is a good technical assignment). I want a remote job. If there is an opportunity to move to the location of the office, I am ready to work in the office. The salary should be sufficient to fulfill my dream of moving to Tenerife with my family and traveling.
