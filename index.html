            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am a passionate Web Developer specializing in Java. 
                I have a strong background in building scalable and efficient web applications. 
                I have three higher education degrees, each with work experience:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Law</li>
                <li>Master of Economics</li>
                <li>Currently working as a Chief Accountant in this field</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, my true passion has always been programming, which I want to turn into my 
                full-time career. I also have a higher education degree in development. 
                I have experience using various applications, including web applications, which is 
                undoubtedly very useful when developing application functionality. During my education, 
                I deeply studied the Java programming language and Spring, and I also have basic knowledge 
                of the following programming languages: C#, Python, JavaScript, and markup languages HTML and CSS. 
                Currently, I am taking a course on advanced frontend development in JavaScript. In the future, 
                I plan to become a full-fledged FullStack developer.</p>

            <h2>Work Preferences</h2>
            <p>I want to work in a team of easy-going people who respect each other, set goals, and achieve them but have humor and a kind heart to support each other in moments of burnout. I am self-sufficient and can work alone when goals and tasks are clearly set (there is a good technical assignment). I want a remote job. If there is an opportunity to move to the location of the office, I am ready to work in the office. The salary should be sufficient to fulfill my dream of moving to Tenerife with my family and traveling.</p>
