                However, my true passion has always been programming, which I want to turn into my 
                full-time career. I also have a higher education degree in development. 
                I have experience using various applications, including web applications, which is 
                undoubtedly very useful when developing application functionality. During my education, 
                I deeply studied the Java programming language and Spring, and I also have basic knowledge 
                of the following programming languages: C#, Python, JavaScript, and markup languages HTML and CSS. 
                Currently, I am taking a course on advanced frontend development in JavaScript. In the future, 
                I plan to become a full-fledged FullStack developer. I have English - A1,
                but I continue to study and plan to take the official exam to obtain a B2 certificate.

            <h2>Work Preferences</h2>
            <p>I want to work in a team of easy-going people who respect each other, set goals, and achieve them but have humor and a kind heart to support each other in moments of burnout.
                I am self-sufficient and can work alone when goals and tasks are clearly set (there is a good technical assignment). I want a remote job.
                If there is an opportunity to move to the location of the office, I am ready to work in the office.
                The salary should be sufficient to fulfill my dream of moving to Tenerife with my family and traveling.<br>
                Issues of salary, Issues of relocation closer to the office location, as well as advanced training are open for discussion.</p>
            <p>
                On my part, I can guarantee full dedication to work. I am quite goal-oriented and assiduous.
                I love creative work (I always have a lot of ideas and thoughts), but I absolutely tolerate monotonous routine work well.
                You can always count on my support in the team to the extent of my capabilities. To achieve the goal,
                I am ready to learn until I achieve the necessary skills to complete the task. Very inquisitive,
                I follow new trends, software and software in the world of IT.
            </p>
            <p>In terms of my worldview, I am more of a pacifist and believe that any form of coercion or pressure is unacceptable.
                However, I am not a fanatic and respect everyone's right to their own opinion.
                I enjoy communicating with interesting people who have unique perspectives on the world.
